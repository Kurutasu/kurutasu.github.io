I'm a researcher belonging to a telecom company. 
My research interests include network engineering, algorithmic trading, machine learning, and shiba-inu :-).
I love python and c++.

# 1. Projects

## 1.a Network engineering

* [Compareing TCP algorithms](https://github.com/haltaro/comparing-tcp-algorithms): Simulating 12 TCP congestion control algoriths with ns-3 simulator and visualizing the results with matplotlib.

## 1.b Algorithmic trading

* [Animating alpha and beta](https://github.com/haltaro/animating-alpha-and-beta): Calculating alphas and betas of the biggest stocks with pandas and making an animation of them with matplotlib.

## 1.c Machine learning

* [Predicting comic end](https://github.com/haltaro/predicting-comic-end): Predicting the end of comic serialized in weekly shonen jump, one of the most popular comic magazines in Japan. I used tensorflow to build a neural network.

## 1.d Shiba-inu

Now preparing ...

# 2. Schooling

I'm taking the following two classes in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) so far. 

## 2.a [Machine learning for trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501): 

A free course including three mini-couses:
1. Manipulating financial data in python
2. Computational investing
3. Machine learning algorithms for trading

I'm now taking mini-couse #2 ...

## 2.b [Deep learning nanodegree foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101): 

A nanodegree course including five projects:

1. [Your first neural network](https://github.com/haltaro/udacity-deep-learning-project1): Build and train my own neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users.

homer_simpson:(moans) i wanna take a nap so i'm awake for the meteor shower.
waylon_smithers: well...(to self) three beers, that's it.
homer_simpson:(to moe, slightly concerned) do you care about all this?
moe_szyslak:(to homer) hey, i don't need your sharity!(cries)

4. Translate a language
5. Generate faces

I'm now coding for project #4 ...
