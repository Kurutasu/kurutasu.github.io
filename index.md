A researcher belonging to a telecom company. 
My research interests include network engineering, algorithmic trading, machine learning, and shiba-inu :-).
I love python and c++.

# 1. Projects

## 1.a Network engineering

* [Compareing TCP algorithms](https://haltaro.github.io/comparing-tcp-algorithms) ([Qiita](http://qiita.com/haltaro/items/d479538345357f08c595), [GitHub](https://github.com/haltaro/comparing-tcp-algorithms)): Simulating 12 TCP congestion control algoriths with ns-3 simulator and visualizing the results with matplotlib.

## 1.b Algorithmic trading

* [Animating alpha and beta](https://haltaro.github.io/animating-alpha-and-beta) ([Qiita](http://qiita.com/haltaro/items/e3e29264079f6b90d6df), [GitHub](https://github.com/haltaro/animating-alpha-and-beta)): Calculating alphas and betas of the biggest stocks with pandas and making an animation of them with matplotlib.

## 1.c Machine learning

* [Predicting comic end](https://haltaro.github.io/predicting-comic-end) ([Qiita part1](http://qiita.com/haltaro/items/c54fa1855767f1a1abd5), [Qiita part2](http://qiita.com/haltaro/items/62d49875ed658ac8a93f), [GitHub](https://github.com/haltaro/predicting-comic-end)): Predicting the end of comic serialized in weekly shonen jump, one of the most popular comic magazines in Japan. I used tensorflow to build a neural network.

* [Deep learning nanodegree in Japanise](https://haltaro.github.io/deep-learning-in-japanese) ([GitHub](https://github.com/haltaro/deep-learning-in-japanese)): Translating the notebooks provided by [Deep learning foundation nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) into Japanese.


## 1.d Shiba-inu

Now preparing ...

# 2. Schooling

I'm taking the following two classes in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) so far. 

## 2.a [Machine learning for trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501) 

A free course including three mini-couses:
1. Manipulating financial data in python
2. Computational investing
3. Machine learning algorithms for trading

I'm now taking mini-couse #2 ...

## 2.b [Deep learning nanodegree foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) 

A nanodegree course including five projects:

* [Project 1 - First neural network](https://github.com/haltaro/udacity-deep-learning-project1/blob/master/DLND%20Your%20first%20neural%20network.ipynb): Build and train my own neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users. The following figure shows the prediction results.

* [Project 2 - Image classification](https://github.com/haltaro/udacity-deep-learning-project2/blob/master/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb): Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network. The following figures show the prediction results.

* [Project 3 - Generate TV scripts](https://github.com/haltaro/udacity-deep-learning-project3/blob/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb): Use a recurrent neural network to generate new scripts for Simpsons. The following scripts are automatically generated ONLY from the word `homer_simpson`.

```
homer_simpson:(upset) marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse...(belches)
homer_simpson:(moans) i wanna take a nap so i'm awake for the meteor shower.
waylon_smithers: well...(to self) three beers, that's it.
homer_simpson:(to moe, slightly concerned) do you care about all this?
moe_szyslak:(to homer) hey, i don't need your sharity!(cries)
```

* [Project 4 - Translate a language](https://github.com/haltaro/udacity-deep-learning-project4/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb): Use a recurrent neural network to translate one language to another. The following French words are automatically translated from the English words.

```
Input
  Word Ids:      [33, 146, 10, 75, 91, 24, 16]
  English Words: ['he', 'saw', 'a', 'old', 'yellow', 'truck', '.']

Prediction
  Word Ids:      [188, 260, 34, 209, 248, 35, 234, 97, 1]
  French Words: il a vu un vieux camion jaune . <EOS>
```


* Project 5 - Generate faces

I'm now coding for project #5 ...
